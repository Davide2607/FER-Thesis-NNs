So first of all, I finally got the correct file, which is called last.pt instead of yolo_last.pt
    - But it still yields a different accuracy value, namely 69% (on adele test set)

Then I tried keeping my code and just using sklearn.metrics.accuracy but still the same result

Then I tried implementing Federica's code exactly, i.e. using model.predict(f"some_folder_path") for each class folder, and it finally gave a different result, but it's 80% :((((

I FOUND OUT! The bosphorus final folder has extra NEUTRAL things that break the final result. Using the images I extracted from Adele's h5 on the evaluate_yolo_folders() version of the evaluator yields 76% !!!! GG
    - Now I need to understand why my results differed though



NEXT STEPS:
> for folders: write code as YOU would write it, and see if the result is the same
    => DONE and OK, it's 76%, so now we have clean code
> for testgen: run model.predict() with the same exact params (apart from folder ofc)
    => DONE and OK, it's again 69%
> see if the prediction are exactly the same between the two:
    - i.e. just save them somewhere and compare them element by element (compare top1 first then if needed also the whole 7 probabilities)
